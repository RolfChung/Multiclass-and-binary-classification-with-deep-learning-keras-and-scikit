# Multiclass-and-binary-classification-with-deep-learning-keras-and-scikit
Multiclass and binary classification with scikit and deep learning keras on two data sets.

<p>
This project meets requirements of two tasks: binomial classification and multiclass classification
</p>

<p>
<b>Binary classification</b> is the task of classifying the elements of a given set into two groups (predicting which group each one belongs to) on the basis of a classification rule. <br>

</p>

<p>
In machine learning, <b>multiclass or multinomial classification</b>  is the problem of classifying instances into one of three or more classes. (Classifying instances into one of two classes is called binary classification.) Multiclass classification should not be confused with multi-label classification, where multiple labels are to be predicted for each instance.

<p>
The data sets used here are the banknote authentication data set and the darts dataset.
</p>

<p>
The <b>banknote authentication</b> data were extracted from images that were taken from genuine and forged banknote-like specimens.  For digitization, an industrial camera usually used for print inspection was used. The final images have 400x 400 pixels. Due to the object lens and distance to the investigated object gray-scale pictures with a resolution of about 660 dpi were gained. Wavelet Transform tool were used to extract features from images.<br>

<p>
The <b>darts data set</b> makes predictions about one of four players based on entry points of the darts on the disc.
</p>

<p>
This project in applies Matplotlib, Pandas, Scikit, Keras and other packages to the data set.</p>

<p>
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.<br>

</p>

<p>
Scikit is a simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis.
It is accessible to everybody, and reusable in various context and built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
